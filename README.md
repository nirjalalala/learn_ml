This repo is intended to assist understanding AI and machine learning. 

This repo contains basic programming with python, to using libraries like numpy, pandas and matplotlib.
It is limited upto machine learning with scikit-learn.

Follow from Day_02 in sequential order.
Don't just run the files. Understand and make twists by yourself.

There are three major projects- 
  1) netflix.ipynb    => EDA on netflix films and scores dataset
